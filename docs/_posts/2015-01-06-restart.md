There has been a long hiatus (ok nearly a year) in development, this has been
a year of other projects which unfortunately got in the way but which have been
very useful in that it means I have been able to re-think how to do this. Also
some developments (such as Docker) have proceeded apace which will make running user
supplied code so much easier and safer.

The API is going to get some rework, I have some ideas on simplifying it and
making it easier to test (using TDD methods).

The Client will get a revamp. As interesting as Coffee Script was, I don't think
it is the way forward. It does not really help, especially when debugging (where
you still need to know what the compiled Javascript is). Instead I will be looking
at AngularJS which looks much more promising.

Initial work will be to take stock of what we have so far, get it back in shape
and in a position where we can move forward again.

If you are interested in collaborating on this project, we are interested in
talking to you! Please email me at sbw@iain-docherty.com
