SpaceBotWar
===========

SpaceBotWar is an attempt to make the best use of HTML5, Web Sockets
and best practice design of front end (Javascript) to make an epic game.

The game concept is quite simple, and you will see the influence of
several existing on-line game. In a nutshell it is a space based game
where you build your empire, send out ships to collect resources and to
attack other players or Artificial Intelligence (AI) enemies.

The choice of HTML5 is because it has now come of age, it is supported by
most modern browsers and the one's which don't support it are not worth
bothering with. We have purposely not chosen Flash so that we can support
the game on many mobile devices natively.

What SpaceBotWar offers, that very few games (if any) offer, is the ability
to program the game using simple languages so that the game runs when you
are not at the terminal.

One influence has undoubtedly been [Lacuna Expanse](http://lacunaexpanse.com)
which has an open API to the game. This resulted in many people writing
external scripts to automate all aspects of the game. Several of the developers
of SpaceBotWar were involved in the ongoing development of 
[Lacuna Expanse](http://lacunaexpanse.com) and have brought that knowledge of
how to develop scalable multi-user games to this project.

This documentation serves as a guide to the developers of the SpaceBotWar 
game, a guide to people who want to write their own scripts via the API, and
a blog showing our thoughts and ideas as we develop the game.

We hope you stay with us and give us feedback as we release parts of the
game over the coming months.
