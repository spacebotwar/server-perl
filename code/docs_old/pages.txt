List of pages that need to be developed for the beta.
=====================================================

1) Registration page.
---------------------
This should use the LoginRadius login so we can allow people with accounts
on Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. to log in using their ID.

a) People should verify who they are using their social network ID.
b) On initial login it should create a basic account using their existing social
   details, email, name etc.
c) They should have an option to change their Nickname


2) Login page.
--------------
Should display the social login buttons (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc) and
should also allow for normal login via nickname and password.


3) Home page.
-------------
Visible to everyone, logged in or not. People not logged in should see the page
and links to register and login.

Introduction to the game.

 * 'Window' showing a current battle, either one running between two players or
   one from the 'tournament' or a 'sample' pre-recorded battle.

 * List of upcoming battles (games scheduled in the tournament) or current 'live'
   battles, allowing the user (logged in or not) to view the battle in real time.

 * Link to show tournament rankings of all programs.


4) Users account
----------------
Option to allow users to change their details.

a) Nickname
b) email address (will require validation)
c) ...

Links to.

  * Show list of all programs written by the user.
  * Link to allow user to create a new program.


5) Tournament rankings
----------------------
This is where the rating of programs/players is shown. The rating depends upon
the outcome of matches between individual programs during a 'tournament' which
is held once a week.

Since it is expected that there may be a large number of programs/players, then
each program will be in a league of up to 30 other programs.

Leagues will be in a hierarchy. Each league can have one parent (except for the
'premier' league) and up to four children.

Winners of a league progress up to the parent league, losers move down.

 * Display a list of all programs.
 * Search by league, or by player name, or by program name.
 * Display for each program the following.
   + name of program
   + programmer
   + current rank.
   + current league
   + number of wins/draws/losses
 * Can drill down for each program to display results of most recent (10?) 
   games.
 * For each recent game can show a replay of the game.
 * Can drill down to show the details of the program.
   + programmer
   + date created
   + name of program it was cloned from (with link?)
   + date of last change
   + (note. can we use github to keep track of modifications?)
   + actual program code.
 * If they wish they can 'clone' an existing program, give it a unique name
   and they can use the programming console to make changes and to test it.


6) Programming console
----------------------
This is where the player can see all their programs and can
their current ranking.

The can also see a list of their public programs and their status.

For any one program of their own, they can 'edit' it


7) Program edit mode
--------------------
People can edit their program here.

  * They can apply changes to their program
  * Their program can be 'submitted' when they are ready.
  * Submission takes place asynchronously, the player is informed when
    their program has passod all tests, or if it fails, why.
  * When their program has been submitted, they can carry out their own
    tests by competing their program against any other in a 'test mode'.
  * Test mode allows the player to see the results of their test in real
    time, or to pause their program and inspect the scratchpad store.
  * Once they are happy with their program they can 'enter' their program
    into a tournament to see how it competes.
